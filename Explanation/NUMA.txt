Non-uniform memory access vs Uniform memory access

Uniform memory access (UMA) is a shared memory architecture used in parallel computers. 
All the processors in the UMA model share the physical memory uniformly.

Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a computer memory design used in multiprocessing, 
where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor. 
Under NUMA, a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory 
(memory local to another processor or memory shared between processors).

NUMA (nonuniform memory access) computers are multiprocessor systems where memory is “local” to
specific groups of processors (“nodes”). Access to local memory is faster than access to nonlocal memory.
On such systems, allocating memory on the correct node is important. Driver authors do not normally have
to worry about NUMA issues, however.

Summary:
UMA跟NUMA是指在多處理器的系統中，記憶體架構的方式。
UMA是每個processor對每個記憶體存取時間都相同。
NUMA是proccessor存取每個記憶體的時間會取決於他們距離，存取本地端的記憶體會較快。
如果有這種架構，有可能在撰寫kernel程式時，要求分配記憶體時，這是一個需要考慮到的點。
